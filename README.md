# Simple Recipe Site
This is a simple site to hold a few recipes. Concepts practiced in building this site will include
- Git commands
- the HTML boilerplate
- basic file structuring
- usage of basic HTML tags (paragraph, strong, emphasis, ordered list, unordered list, etc.)
- page linking
- probably more, but can't think of them right now
